Send anonymous messages with a *totally not secure* anti-bot system (aka "press button to prove human").  
Because reCAPTCHA is too mainstream.

---

##  Features

- Anonymous messaging (nobody knows who sent it‚Ä¶ except you)  
- "Are you human?" check (spoiler: it‚Äôs just a button)  
- Messages go straight into **Discord** via webhook  
- Only works if you have the secret link ‚Üí so high security üîê
- 100% **Open Source Garbage‚Ñ¢**

## How to Use

1. Clone or fork this repo.  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chin-x1919/anonymous_q-a.git
   ```
   or just hit the **Fork** button on GitHub.

2. Edit `index.html` and replace:
   ```html
   const SECRET_KEY = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"; (Line121)
   const DISCORD_WEBHOOK = "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK"; (Line167)
   ```
   with your actual secret key and Discord webhook URL.
   (Line numbers may change if I mess with the code later, so ctrl+F it if needed.)


4. Run it on literally anything that serves HTML:  
   - XAMPP  
   - Apache/Nginx  
   - GitHub Pages (yes, it even works there lol)  
   - Or just double-click `index.html` like a caveman ü™®

5. Create a link with your key:  
   ```
   http://localhost/index.html?Key=Something
   ```

6. Send the link to your friends ‚Üí they type ‚Üí they send ‚Üí you get Discord notifications instantly.

## Why not use NGL?

Because NGL looks polished.  
And me? I like my tools like I like my humor:  
**O P E N S O U R C E & S T U P I D**  
(actually i just hate third party app)
