# Anonymous Q&A but Opensource

![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green) 
![Open Source Garbage](https://img.shields.io/badge/open--source-garbage-red)
 
Send anonymous messages with a *totally not secure* anti-bot system (aka "press button to prove human").  
Because reCAPTCHA is too mainstream.

---

##  Features

- Anonymous messaging (nobody knows who sent it‚Ä¶ yep noone if you don't believe me go read source code)  
- "Are you human?" check (spoiler: it‚Äôs just a button)  
- Messages go straight into **Discord** via webhook  
- Only works if you have the secret link ‚Üí so high security üîê
- 100% **Open Source Garbage‚Ñ¢**

## Why not use NGL?

Because NGL looks polished.  
And me? I like my tools like I like my humor:  
**O P E N S O U R C E & S T U P I D**  
(actually i just hate third party app)

##NGL vs This Potato Project

### NGL (corporate edition)
- Download the app (big as a dumpster)  
- Sign up, log in, done in 1 min  
- Polished UI, scale = millions

---

### This project (budget < 20 THB)
- Fork this repo  
- Edit the code (yes, manually)  
- Push to GitHub Pages  
- Pray it builds  
- Finally‚Ä¶ it works üéâ  

So yeah‚Ä¶ **it‚Äôs actually harder to use than NGL.**  
But hey, at least it‚Äôs **O P E N S O U R C E** ‚ú®
